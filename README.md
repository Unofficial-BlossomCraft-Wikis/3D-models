# 3D-models
## Accessing the Model
use this setup:
```
https://cdn.blossomcraft.dovahkiin.xyz/3D-models/blob/main/{Crate Name}/{3D model name}.gltf
```
a CDN URL compleated should look like:
```
https://cdn.blossomcraft.dovahkiin.xyz/3D-models/blob/main/christmas2023/key.gltf
```

You can also use [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/):
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Unofficial-BlossomCraft-Wikis/3D-models@main/{Crate Name}/{3D model name}.gltf
```
a CDN URL completed should look like this:
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Unofficial-BlossomCraft-Wikis/3D-models@main/christmas2023/key.gltf
```

to embed the model into a website I recommend [Google's model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/):
```html
<script type="module" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/model-viewer/3.1.1/model-viewer.min.js"></script>
...
<model-viewer alt="key" src="https://cdn.blossomcraft.dovahkiin.xyz/3D-models/blob/main/christmas2022/key.gltf" shadow-intensity="1" autoplay camera-controls touch-action="pan-y" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;" camera-orbit="90deg 55deg 4m"></model-viewer>
```
